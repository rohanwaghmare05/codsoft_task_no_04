# Task 4: Sales Prediction Project
- This project focuses on evaluating and visualizing the performance of a linear regression model for predicting sales based on advertising spend.

Objective:
- To build and assess a regression model that predicts sales figures from TV advertising spend.
  
Features:
1. **Dataset**: Sales dataset with features such as TV advertising spend and Sales.
2. **Techniques Used**: Model fitting, evaluation using RMSE and R-squared, and various visualizations.

Models Implemented:
- Linear Regression model was used to fit the data and make predictions.

Key Technologies:
1. **Programming Language**: Python
2. **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, StatsModels, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Key Metrics:
1. **R-squared**: 81.6%
2. **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**

Visualizations:
1. Residuals vs Fitted Values Plot
2. Q-Q Plot for residuals
3. Prediction vs Actual Values Plot

- The analyses and visualizations provide insights into the model's performance and its ability to predict sales effectively.
